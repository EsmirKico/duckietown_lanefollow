# 🧹 Project Cleanup Guide

## Why Clean Up?

You currently have **two folders** that might be confusing:
- `duckietown_lanefollow/` ← **Main project (USE THIS)**
- `proj-lfvop-master/` ← **Reference only (can be deleted)**

## 🎯 What to Keep vs. Delete

### ✅ **KEEP (Main Project)**
```
duckietown_lanefollow/
├── Dockerfile                    ← ✅ Use this one
├── dependencies-py3.txt          ← ✅ All dependencies here
├── packages/
│   ├── dynamic_obstacle_avoidance/  ← ✅ Integrated features
│   ├── object_detection/           ← ✅ YOLOv5 detection
│   └── lane_control/              ← ✅ Lane following
└── DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md           ← ✅ Complete instructions
```

### ❌ **SAFE TO DELETE (Reference)**
```
proj-lfvop-master/
├── Dockerfile                    ← ❌ Don't use this
├── dependencies-*.txt            ← ❌ Already merged
├── packages/                     ← ❌ Already integrated
└── README.md                     ← ❌ Just documentation
```

## 🗑 **How to Clean Up**

### **Option 1: Safe Cleanup (Recommended)**
```bash
# Navigate to your workspace
cd /path/to/your/workspace

# Create backup (just in case)
mv proj-lfvop-master/ proj-lfvop-master.backup

# Test the main project works
cd duckietown_lanefollow/
dts devel build -f --arch arm32v7 -H [DUCKIEBOT_NAME].local

# If everything works, delete the backup
rm -rf proj-lfvop-master.backup/
```

### **Option 2: Direct Deletion**
```bash
# If you're confident, directly delete
rm -rf proj-lfvop-master/
```

## 🚀 **After Cleanup - Single Command Usage**

Once cleaned up, you'll have a **simple, single-project workflow**:

```bash
# Build
cd duckietown_lanefollow/
dts devel build -f --arch arm32v7 -H [DUCKIEBOT_NAME].local

# Run with dynamic obstacle avoidance
docker -H [DUCKIEBOT_NAME].local run -it --rm --net host -v /data/:/data/ \
  duckietown/dt-core:master-arm32v7 \
  roslaunch duckietown_demos lane_following_with_dynamic_avoidance.launch veh:=[DUCKIEBOT_NAME]
```

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

After cleanup, verify everything works:

- [ ] Only `duckietown_lanefollow/` folder exists
- [ ] `dts devel build` works without errors
- [ ] Dynamic obstacle avoidance launch file works
- [ ] No confusion about which Dockerfile to use

## 🤔 **Why Was There Two Folders?**

- **`proj-lfvop-master`**: Original research project for dynamic obstacle avoidance
- **`duckietown_lanefollow`**: Your main lane following project

I **integrated** the best parts of `proj-lfvop-master` into your main project, so you get:
- ✅ All the dynamic avoidance features
- ✅ Single build process
- ✅ No duplicate code
- ✅ Clean project structure

**Result: One unified project with all features! 🎉**
